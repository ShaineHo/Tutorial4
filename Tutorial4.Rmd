## Learning to reference figures.




```{r Figref, fig.cap="This is random noise"}
x = seq(1:100)
y = rnorm(100)
dat = data.frame(x, y)
ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y))+
  geom_line()

```

The above Figure \@ref(fig:Figref) is some random plot.

## Learning to reference tables
```{r newtable}
dat_tbl <- head(dat,10)
```


```{r}
ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y))+
  geom_point()
```

The above table \@ref(tab:newtable) is 5 observations of the overall table on which above plot was created
